"""Node actions.

These are actions that appear as buttons on the UI's Node page, depending
on the node's state, the user's privileges etc.

To define a new node action, derive a class for it from :class:`NodeAction`,
provide the missing pieces documented in the class, and add it to
`ACTION_CLASSES`.  The actions will always appear on the page in the same
order as they do in `ACTION_CLASSES`.
